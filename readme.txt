My C_Library, containing useful functions for my EPITECH projects.

It contains base functions from my "piscine" at TECH,
+ Other useful functions I needed for my projects,
+ CSFML functions for a potential game in C,

make base : for base functions,
make new : for functions I created not included in base,
make printf : for my_printf,
make csfml : for csfml lib,
make all : do I need to specify?
